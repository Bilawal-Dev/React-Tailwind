-> In your useEffect hooks:
 - The first hook loads the stored tasks from localStorage when the component mounts.
 - The second hook saves the tasks to localStorage whenever tasks changes.

-> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used for storing and transporting data. 
   It's designed to be easy to read and write for humans, and easy to parse and generate for machines.
   JSON represents data as a string in a structured format (like an object or array) with key-value pairs.

 - Without JSON: You can directly store and retrieve simple strings in localStorage.
 - With JSON: You need to use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse to handle more complex data types (like arrays or objects) when working with localStorage.-

-> In your current React app, since you're storing an array of tasks, JSON is necessary to handle the conversion between the array and the string format that localStorage requires.

- JSON.stringify: Converts a JavaScript object or array into a JSON string.
- JSON.parse: Converts a JSON string back into a JavaScript object or array.

-> ReactStrictMode May Interfere With Code That Interacts With LocaleStorage or Similar APIs Because It useEffect() Twice Resulting In Strange Behaviour
